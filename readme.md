Hey! 👋🏽 This is a *[Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)* to collect knowledge on different web development topics so I can be not just a competent engineer but a *good* one.

Here you'll find notes from different courses, blog posts, and books I've read on the topic of React, web development, JavaScript, API design, and backend engineering, perhaps maybe even a little *DevOps*.

You can jump around the site using the *Wiki links* below.

## Courses

- [[React for Beginners]]
- [[Interviewing for Frontend Engineers]]
- [[Advanced React]]
- [[GraphQL]]
- [[Testing React Apps]]
- [[Redux]]
