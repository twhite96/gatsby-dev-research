There are a few [[YouTube Channels]] you should check out if you're anything like me and want to prototype and build things for fun.

There are also some [[Where to buy parts wholesale|places online you can go to buy parts on the cheap.]]

### Goals for these notes

- Share whatever interesting bits of information I come across on the subject of electronics and electronics engineering
- Share links to my findings on each build/prototype/experiment I do on my engineering blog https://tiffinthelab.org
