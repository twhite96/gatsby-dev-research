# Functions in math
[What is a Function](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function.html)

A function relates an input to an output.

It is like a machine that has an input and an output.

And the output is related somehow to the input.


f(x)  	
"f(x) = ... " is the classic way of writing a function.
And there are other ways, as you will see!

# Input, Relationship, Output

We will see many ways to think about functions, but there are always three main parts:

- The input
- The relationship
- The output
