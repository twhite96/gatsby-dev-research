# Inbox

- Here you can write disorganised notes to be categorised later
- Bullet points are useful, but it could be free form text as well
- Sometimes it's better to just get things off your mind quickly, rather than stop to think where it belongs
- But don't let this list get too long
- Move information to more specific documents and link to them.
  - This helps you navigate between documents quickly
  - For example, you can `Cmd`+`Click` this: [[todo]]
- Some notes don't end up making sense the next day
- That's ok, you can just delete them!
  - You can always find them in your git history, if you really need it!


# Functions in math
[What is a Function](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function.html)

A function relates an input to an output.

It is like a machine that has an input and an output.

And the output is related somehow to the input.


  f(x)  	
"f(x) = ... " is the classic way of writing a function.
And there are other ways, as you will see!

# Input, Relationship, Output

We will see many ways to think about functions, but there are always three main parts:

- The input
- The relationship
- The output
