# Rewrite the blog in one of the following technologies:

- Eleventy: https://11ty.dev
- Swyxkit: https://swyxkit.netlify.app

## Steps taken:

Forked a couple repos:

https://github.com/josephrexme/josephrex.me
https://github.com/maxboeck/mxb
https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone
https://github.com/maxboeck/eleventastic

Pulled down repo from Joseph Rex, added a `testing` and `staging` branches to the blog repo at https://github.com/twhite96/TWBlog and added Joseph's repo to the testing branch which you can find here:
