# Two-Way Data Binding

> ...when you render a grid, for example, there are 2 parts, the representation (view) and data (model). 2-way data binding is when changing model changes the view and changing the view changes the model. So if you think it in terms of events, when a model changes, the view listens to the change and changes itself and vice-versa. Magic right?
