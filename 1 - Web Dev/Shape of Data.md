What is meant by the _shape_ of data? `structs`, `fields`, `members`, `classes`, `objects`. OOP is such a rabbit hole. Must See:

## OK

In OOP, I suppose the *shape* of data is its structure, much like you learn in your first CS class.

A `class` is a blueprint on how to build, i.e. structure, a house or car, and an `object` is that thing you've built which is a result of that blueprint. `methods` and/or `properties` are types of house, for instace; a Row Home is a type of House which we have a `class` that is the blueprint for all the homes in that neighborhood etc. ^6b8591

See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3141957/a-good-object-oriented-analogy

So, a blueprint is some structure of data, some disparate items we need to collect to build our house. ^3d8004


Just thinking this through so the [[#^3d8004]]
